# Jonathon Blom Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio website, built with React. It is also deployed on Netlify. This portfolio showcases my ability to create a polished website, with different pages and projects for potential employers to view. There is a resume tab that allows a user to download my resume, a contact tab, and a portfolio tab with links to my deployed projects. It also has a header and a footer that persists throughout the site. I've included my contact information in the footer provided.
